# Greedy Algorithm for the Set Cover Problem
An implementation of a greedy algorithm for the set cover optimization problem (Chvatal, V 1979)

## Greedy Algorithm
Set cover optimization problem is NP-hard.
The greedy algorithm finds a solution at most H(n) times as large as the minimum cover within O(n^3) time, 
where H(n) is the n-th harmonic number and n be the size of the universe.
